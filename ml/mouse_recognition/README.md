# Project: Mouse recognition with neural networks

This project is a web application that allows users to interact with a deep neural network that
analyzes mouse input patterns. The neural network is based on a Fully Convolutional Network
used for time series classification and it's based on this research paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06455 Time Series Classification from Scratch with Deep Neural Networks: A Strong Baseline

The project contains three folders:

model/ : Contains the neural network model and all the research and investigations that I had
to do to train it.

backend/ : Contains a core backend proccess that executes the neural network and receives input from 
the webapp backend

webapp/ : Contains the backend and the frontend of the web application
